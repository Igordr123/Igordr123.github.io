Slovenia has been proclaimed one of Europe's greenest destinations on many occasions. The small country with its magnificent nature and long history marked by the strategic need of great powers to dominate and control. 

We make ourselves available and can offer tailor-made experiences: from authentic experiences around the table - world-class wine and gastronomy - to both simple, simple nature experiences where everyone can participate. 

We are really good at listening to your needs and assisting you in getting the best out of both single-day experiences and longer-term trips. We are specialists in Slovenia and the region in general. Ask us anything and we will do our best to educate you so you can make the best decision. We only work with local professionals. Whom we know, have met and would even choose as partners. Regardless of whether it is about logistics or form of travel (we love trains), we offer your dreams. 

What makes Slovenia and our own region, with Škofja Loka as a base, unique is that there is never far for new experiences. We have a weakness for the good story. What does your best version of a vacation sound like?
