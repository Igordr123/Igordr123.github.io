The Secret of Margareta’s Ring

In 1396 the Loka custodian Nikolaj of Loka ordered the town jeweller and engraver to make a magic ring with the inscription Caspar Melchior Baltasar, which was supposed to protect the wearer of the ring from diseases and various dangers. Nikolaj of Loka gave the ring to Barbara Lambergar, a lady from Škofja Loka, who in 1439 left it to her granddaughter Margareta. Since many had tried to steal the ring, Barbara hid it and in her will and diary wrote instructions how to find it. They were difficult times for the Loka dominion, as bloody battles were being played out on its borders between the Counts of Celje and the Habsburgs. The town was beseiged by the Celje commander-in-chief Jan Vitovec. Margareta made a quick getaway from the town to safety, but left the ring in Škofja Loka. Your task is to find Margareta’s ring before others do and hand it to the guardian of the ring.

Hurry before the town gates close!
