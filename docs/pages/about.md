### Vision

We are storytellers of origin. Our DNA is journalism. In fact, everything we do is based on the basic of good practice in journalism. Fascination. Educational. Inspirational. We work with a smile on our faces. Life is too short for grumpiness. And we believe in the idea of a great place to live is a wonderful place to visit. We do NOT have all the answers, but the question is: Do we need to know everything in order to be the best version of ourselves?

### Mission

Our overarching mission is to assist and empower you towards a better understanding of how the world of today is. We strive to assist anyone we are involved in to feel wanted. Authenticity is not old school. Dignity is woke. Respectful behaviour all along is key. We call it a life long journey of formation. 

Lokatur wishes to carry out its initiatives in a climate of respect and collaboration with the people we are trying to help, thereby ensuring that they are empowered by the interaction. This means that we always strive to collaborate with people whom we share same values. Our core sentence is: “A story is a promise.” Stories that may change your set of mind, maybe even inspire you.
